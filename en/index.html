                    I'm an 19-year-old student with a passion for various fields. My time is sectionided between hobbies such as gardening, 3D modeling and electronics. Mathematics and computer science are subjects I'm passionate about and feel comfortable in, which is reflected in my good results. I'm a naturally calm and low-stress person, which enables me to be punctual and independent. I like to take things in hand and often, in group work, I become the leader, guiding the project to completion. Winter is my favorite season, the atmosphere is particularly invigorating and I have a weakness for good food. Having obtained my driving license, I love exploring new places and discovering new things. You could say I'm quite stubborn, a quality that drives me to complete everything I set out to do. I like to help others and I'm there to support those who need me, because they know they can count on my help and commitment.

                <section id="why" class="box"><h2>Currently</h2><article>
                    I study at the IUT in Colmar. The network and telecommunications course suits me perfectly. My future dream is to become a network engineer in a large company. I find that IT is a vast and immersive field that is exciting, and I've been passionate about it since I was very young, and will continue to be for a very long time. However, communication in IT is a complex aspect; but that doesn't scare me, I need to exercise my neurons on a daily basis in order to stay active.
